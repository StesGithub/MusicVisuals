## Description
This audio visualisation of Skeeter Davises' (1962) "The End of the World" follows the story of a lone individual walking down the endless street as there is a meteor in the sky. As he walks down the street, we can see how his town and suffered more damage from people panicking than the meteor itself. The background changes slowly as the song progresses, while the city skyscrapers in the background red in fire, as well as the trail behind the meteor, reacting to the amplitude of the song.

## Quickstart Guide
- Navigate to the **java/** folder
- Run **Compile_and_Run.bat** (or **Compile_and_Run.sh** if using a UNIX system)
- Enjoy
- Feel free to run the other **.bat** scripts, as these were visuals which were later incorporated themselves into the main visual

## How it works
1. We initialised all of the variables and objects to be used throughout the project

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
